cytof-backer-upper
==================

Powershell script for incrementally backing up CyTOF data. Features compression of IMD files (only), interruptable-resumable backup operations and good logging.

Use the latest _v3.ps1 file. (The previous versions were for earlier versions of PowerShell and Windows XP.)

A known working configuration is WinSCP 5.5.6 and 7-Zip 9.20.
